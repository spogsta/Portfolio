# Portfolio
Going to be a main page for my portfolio site.


So far I added a neat little button function that scrolls down a VH at a set speed. NEAT. 

Brainstorming design and content ideas - I think I have a general color scheme in mind - but I'm unsure if it will work and where I'll find some of the resources I want. - thinking a stained glass ocean blue cathedral look would be neat. 

I still need to comment my code. 


created a neat carousel function that spins between different images - going to probably use this as a "languages I've learnt" kind of thing. It's pretty cool.

again, still need to comment code.
