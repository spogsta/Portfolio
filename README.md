# Portfolio
Going to be a main page for my portfolio site.


So far I added a neat little button function that scrolls down a VH at a set speed. NEAT. - I think it looks cool but IDK how to design buttons AT ALL


I still need to comment my code. 


created a neat carousel function that spins between different images - going to probably use this as a "languages I've learnt" kind of thing. It's pretty cool. Not centered for some reason though...idk. CSS lol.

again, still need to comment code.


Fixed a few formatting things, going to park this project for a few days until I have the time to do some photoshopping/AI-generated images or something. I need to mull around how I want to design the project/programming languages known section. I'm at a bit of an impass with how I want to design this. It doesn't necassarily need to be complete until I finish my capstone projects.
